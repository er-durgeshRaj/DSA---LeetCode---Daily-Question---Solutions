// QUESTION
// You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

// ​Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2

// Output: 8

// Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.

// After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

// Example 2:

// Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1

// Output: 6

// Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.

// With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

// Example 3:

// Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3

// Output: 10

// Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.

// There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= tasks.length <= 104
// tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
// 0 <= n <= 100

public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int p) {
        int n = tasks.size();
        unordered_map<char, int> mp;
        
        for(char &ch : tasks) {
            mp[ch]++;
        }

        priority_queue<int> pq; //max heap
        //we want to finish the process which is most occurring (having highest frequency)
        //so that we don't have to finish in the last with p gaps.
        int time = 0;
        
        for(auto &it : mp) {
            pq.push(it.second);
        }
        
        while(!pq.empty()) {
            vector<int> temp;
            for(int i = 1; i<=p+1; i++) {
                //filling first p+1 characters
                if(!pq.empty()) {
                    temp.push_back(pq.top()-1); //finishing one instance of each process
                    pq.pop();
                }
            }
            
            for(int &freq : temp) {
                if(freq > 0)
                    pq.push(freq);
            }
            
            if(pq.empty()) //all processes finished
                time += temp.size();
            else
                time += (p+1); //we finished p+1 tasks above in the loop
            
        }
        
        return time;
    }
